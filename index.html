               <h4>"No matter where you're from,your dreams are valid."</h4>
               <p>Ever heard the saying “dreams don’t work unless you do” by John C. Maxwell? This is true, because dreaming without a plan of how to make those dreams a reality will get you nowhere, and could leave you feeling frustrated. Planning is crucial for converting your dreams into action.</p>

                    <h4><span class="name-highlight">"2020-present | Pro level developer"</span></h4>
                    <p>I was definitely not a “full stack developer” on day one, or year one, two or three. At least I didn’t call myself one for a long time. For one thing, the term “full stack developer” wasn’t popular at the time. But as JavaScript libraries (jQuery) and frameworks (Angular, React) became common place in the industry, and CSS libraries (Bootstrap, Foundation) replaced writing your stylesheets by hand, there became demand to be capable in both the front-end and back-end.</p>

                    <p>The building blocks of many websites are HTML and CSS. Front end developers have mastered the art of these two languages to create the cornucopia of websites that inhabit the internet.And JavaScript is used to create advanced website features, which are not possible with HTML.These is all about front end.On the otherhand, Back end developers are familiar with a whole set of other languages.Thanks Programming Hero Team for everything I an learning in this beautiful journey.</p>
